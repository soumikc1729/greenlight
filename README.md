# Let's Go Further
This repository contains my code while working through **[Let's Go Further](https://lets-go-further.alexedwards.net/)** by Alex Edwards.
It explores building a production-ready web application in Go, covering authentication, authorization, middleware, database integrations, and more.

## Running
To run the application, execute:
```bash
go run ./cmd/api/main.go
```

## Contributing
